Text Encrypter
A Python-based cybersecurity tool for encrypting and decrypting text using three major encryption algorithms: AES (via Fernet), DES, and RSA. The application supports both command-line and graphical user interfaces (GUI) for secure and user-friendly text encryption.

Features
Supports three encryption algorithms:

AES (via Fernet)

DES (Data Encryption Standard)

RSA (Rivest–Shamir–Adleman)

Encrypt plain text and save to encrypted.txt

Decrypt encrypted text either from input or file

Automatically manages secret keys and RSA key pairs

GUI built with Tkinter for easy interaction

Command-line support for quick usage

Logging of all encryption/decryption activity (activity.log)

Option to clear logs and encrypted data

Installation
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/ShaborniS/text-encrypter.git

Navigate to the project directory:
cd text-encrypter

Install the required Python packages:
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage
🖥 Command Line
You can run the script to encrypt or decrypt via terminal (to be implemented or documented).

🪟 GUI
Run the GUI application:
python gui_app.py

Select the algorithm (AES, DES, RSA), enter your text, and choose to Encrypt or Decrypt.
